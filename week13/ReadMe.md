Galactic Getaway (WORKING TITLE)
A side scrolling endless runner
Control a space alien ship up and down using the space button to dodge enemies and collect stars while trying to go further and further to get the highest score.

My main inspiration is the game Jetpack Joyride, a mobile game that was very popular when I was young. I am taking inspiration from the simple but fun mechanics of the movement using only one button. Taping (or holding space in my game) moves the character up and letting go makes the character fall back down. This movement paired with the moving background and constant obstacles makes for an immersive experience.

There are a few things that I well need to learn/research such as collisions so that the star collection and enemy contact mechanics work. I will also need to look into how to make the background not only move with the character but also loop endlessly.

This past week I have worked on creating the art and have created the very basic movements

This week: Get the looping background working and refine character movement. Finish the rest of the art. I will have a lot more time this weekend so I will be able to get a bulk of the work done then.

Next week: Work on enemy spawning and movement and star spawning. Finish up with collision and collection and a game over screen.
