Usually, homework assignments where you are required to watch a very long video bore me. But this video captured my attention fully right at the beginning. Pausch walks us through how he achieved nearly all of his childhood dreams in one way or another. What affected me the most about this lecture was his repeated use of a brick wall allegory. Over and over through the video, he brought up all the brick walls he faced while pursuing his dreams. And he, unlike other people, did not see these walls as the end of the road. He saw it as something to get over to keep going. A part that hit hard was when he said “The brick walls are not there to stop the people who want it badly enough, they're there to stop the other people”. I have never really thought about looking at obstacles in my life like this but I believe that if I view them through this lens in the future, I will end up working harder to get past my walls. I really identified with his message of how the things you learn along the way can sometimes be more valuable and rewarding than the original end goal. His journey through football to get to the NFL but instead learning valuable things along the way reminded me a lot about how my journey through university is going. My dreams are ambitious but I feel what I have learned and experienced already has surpassed everything. This was an amazing video to watch and I truly love the message behind it.
