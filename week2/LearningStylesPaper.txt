I 100% believe that learning styles can affect the way each person learns. I for one am a very hands-on and visual learner. I learn best when I am both seeing and working through problems. I have found classes that focus solely on lectures and textbooks over hands-on work extremely hard. I tend to do much better in classes where we are constantly working though problems and drawing out how they are solved. But this type of learning that is easy for me is difficult for others. I have a friend who excels and classes that are lecture-heavy. They take extensive notes through these classes and usually go through them with ease. Meanwhile classes that require hands-on work with no time to take notes are much harder for them. I think its very interesting that each person can differ so wildly in this regard. The article that we were given to read shows a study that suggests that people will perform the same whether or not the way they study aligns with their self-perceived learning style or not. I find this very interesting and myself and the people I know seem to have believe that it does indeed matter. It would be very interesting to see this type of experiment run on different education levels and different types of classes and tests.
